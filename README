PROJECT: LearnLanguages
AUTHOR: William Raiford (bill.mybiz@gmail.com)


VISION: I want the absolute best software to learn languages quickly, efficiently, and organically to maximize enjoyment and retention, and minimize time investment.  I also want a specific goal, currently 2000 words in each of 5 languages, and I want to see just _one_ real number metric to see my progress towards that goal in any particular language.  I want to be able to write in a bunch of text, have the app persist that text, and allow quick user actions to create translations in multiple languages to grow just a database of text and text relationships.  Eventually, I want to include item scheduling using a neural net to maximize retention and minimize repetitions necessary for learning.

NOTES ON BUILDING/RUNNING:
-Be sure to manually set the IISHost project as the StartUp Project.
-To switch between the Mock and Ef data providers: IISHost project -> Web.config -> <appsettings> -> key="DalManagerType".
-To switch between Silverlight Unit Testing UI and the actual Silverlight app UI: IISHost project -> Project Properties -> Web tab -> Specific Page(.TestsTestPage is the UnitTesting page right now - bad naming sorry).
-I usually work in a feature branch and then merge it back into master, so for most up-to-date code, check out the [feature] branch.
