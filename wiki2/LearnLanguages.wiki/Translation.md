### Definition:
A translation is a group of phrases that mean "the same thing" in a given context in various languages. 

### Notes:
* The context must be a phrase in some language, ie there will be an entry for that context phrase, it isn't just a random text string.
* For right now, synonyms in the same language will fall under the category of translation, i.e. an intra-language translation.
