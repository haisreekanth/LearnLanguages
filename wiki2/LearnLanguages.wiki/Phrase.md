### Definition:
A phrase is any length of text in a certain language. 

### Notes:
* A single word is a phrase.
* A phrase cannot be directly "linked" with two or more languages. E.g. Faux pas is an English phrase and a French phrase. This would require two separate, distinct entries in the database.
