PROBLEM: Not able to talk to DB at all.  Blowing up at the first call in the form of context.[dbcall], e.g. (context.DatabaseExists(), .CreateDatabase(), etc).

Exception:
"A network-related or instance-specific error occurred while establishing a connection to SQL Server. The server was not found or was not accessible. Verify that the instance name is correct and that SQL Server is configured to allow remote connections. (provider: Named Pipes Provider, error: 40 - Could not open a connection to SQL Server)"

Re: Creating a new DB using model first with Entity Framework

Hello:)

In my mind, you can just copy and paste the SQL statement codes into the Sql management studio and run to get the whole db, and then close SQL management studio.

In the end, plz create an edmx file and importing all the tables belonging to the specific db to automatically create the db models.

------------------

TWO THINGS I HAD TO DO:

1) I ended up doing what this says.  Opened SQL Management Studio, created new query, copied the generated SQL script that pops up when choosing "Generate Database from Model", and executed the query (didn't save the query).

2) I changed the connection string's data source to be USER-PC\SQLEXPRESS, as follows:

Correct:
    <add name="LearnLanguagesContext" connectionString="metadata=res://*/LearnLanguages.csdl|res://*/LearnLanguages.ssdl|res://*/LearnLanguages.msl;provider=System.Data.SqlClient;provider connection string=&quot;data source=USER-PC\SQLEXPRESS;initial[...]" />

Incorrect:
    <!--<add name="LearnLanguagesContext" connectionString="metadata=res://*/LearnLanguages.csdl|res://*/LearnLanguages.ssdl|res://*/LearnLanguages.msl;provider=System.Data.SqlClient;provider connection string=&quot;data source=USER-PC;initial[...]" />-->
